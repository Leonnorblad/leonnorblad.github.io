about_content: |
  Final year Master's student in Statistics and Machine Learning.
  I am eager to follow the advancements in AI/ML to see how we can utilize it in the industry to improve the quality of our future lives.
  I believe AI has a significant role in a more sustainable future. 
  Currently, I am writing my master's thesis at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE), where I am developing a machine vision solution to improve the sorting of pre-used textiles.
  Once my thesis is completed in June, I am interested in full-time employment in AI/ML, preferably in Stockholm.

  Hit me up if you are looking for:
  - An awesome colleague to join your team üåü
  - A collaborator on a ML projectü§ù

  Or just want to chat about AI/ML in generalüí°

        sub_title: Damage detection in circular fashion
        description: |
          I am currently working on my master's thesis at the Research Institutes of Sweden.
          My thesis is a part of the EU project *Circular and Sustainable Textile and Clothing* <a href="https://cisutac.eu" target="_blank">cisutac.eu</a>.
          Which is a large initiative to increase textile circularity in Europe.
          More specifically, my thesis aims to automate the sorting process.
          By using machine vision, I am developing a damage detection model to gain a better understanding of the condition of the garment.
          This information is essential for a sorting decision.
          During the whole spring, we also have weekly paper reviews where we take a deep dive into a recent paper.
          I find workshops like this essential as the field of AI/ML is moving at a rapid pace.

          As a part of the LiU text-mining 732A81 course, I decided to dive deeper into the task of fact verification.
          The model I developed analyzes a user input string and predicts it's truthfulness. This is performed by
          comparing the input string to a paragraph of evidence. To extract claims and evidence to train the model I
          scraped Wikipedia pages and then fed the articles together with instructions to generate a claim to ChatGPT
          with the help of OpenAIs API. I then embedded the claims and evidence using BERT and trained the classification network.
          Code and pdf report is available on my GitHub.

        description: |
         As a part of the LiU course Bioinformatics 732A51, I developed an R package for sequence alignment and visualization.
         The package uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align biological sequences such as protein or nucleotide sequences.
         It also provides the option to visualize the alignment in a matrix plot with arrows illustrating the paths and scores of different alignments.
         The package is available on CRAN and can be installed to R simply by running `install.packages("SeqAlignR")`.

          Competition hosted by Kaggle.
          The task was to distinguish between essays written by a large language model and essays written by a human.
          Together with my two teammates <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-forsblom/" target="_blank">Elias Forsblom</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/filip-furuhed" target="_blank"> Filip Furuhed</a>  we developed an ensemble model consisting of Multinomial Naive Bayes,
          Stochastic Gradient Descent (with modified Huber loss), LightGBM (gradient boosting model), and CatBoost (gradient boosting on decision trees).
          A key aspect of our solution, except the use of an ensemble model, was to use a large ngram in our vectorization of the text.
          Our final submission reached a private LB AUC score of 0.893, giving us a top 36% placement.

          Competition hosted by Kaggle.
          The task was to predict the future performance based on a student's gameplay in an educational game.
          According to our review of the game, the player must pay attention at specific points to answer the questions correctly.
          Because of this, me and my teammate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-forsblom/" target="_blank">Elias Forsblom</a> decided to base our features on the number of clicks and time spent in different rooms in the game.
          In total, the player had to answer 18 different questions at three different levels.
          We leveraged XGBoost's capability of ranking features by importance to find a subset of relevant features for each of the 18 questions.
          We then fitted both a neural network and an XGBoost model on the selected features.
          This was a great learning experience as it was our first time attending a competition on Kaggle.
          Our solution was novel but unfortunately did not perform well in the competition, leaving us on a top 61% placement.

         Me and my partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roosisabella" target="_blank">Isabella Roos</a> developed forecasting models predicting service matters for the properties at <a href="https://www.al.se/" target="_blank">Atrium Ljungberg</a>.
         The forecasts can be used to make data-driven staff schedule decisions.
         By adjusting the staffing plan to the volume of service matters both overstaffing and understaffing can be avoided.
         This benefits employees, the company, and enhances the overall customer experience.
         The most successful strategy was found to model each area separately.
         Traditional statistical time-series modeling, dynamic regression models, and machine learning methods were explored.
         Summary, code, and full pdf (abstract in English) are available on my GitHub.

        description: |
          I found this program to be the perfect start for my data science career.
          The program was a mix of established statistical methods, programming, mathematics, and machine learning.
          Most courses were divided into the lecture + lab + computer exam structure.
          I found this teaching technique to be very effective as it gives a deep understanding of the theory as well as practical skills.
          Many courses also contained a small project, allowing me to be creative and apply the learned methods to real data, something I enjoyed.

          After the BSc program introduced me to the world of data science, I was eager to learn more.
          The program followed a similar structure as the BSc program, but with more advanced models and a deeper dive into the methods.
          This extended my toolbox to work with new data types and models. I will graduate in June 2024, thrilled to see what the future holds.
