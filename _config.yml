        title: Claim Verification Using Generated Data by ChatGPT and Wikipedia

          As a part of the LiU text-mining course, I decided to dive deeper in the task of fact verification.
          The model I developed analyzes a user input string and predicts the truthfulness. This is performed by
          comparing the input string to a paragapth of *evidence*. To extract claims and evidence to train the model I
          scraped wikipedia pages and then fed the articles together with instructions to generate a claim to ChatGPT
          with the help of OpenAIs API. The Wikipedia articles could then be used as evidence and the output generated by
          the GPT model could be used as claims. I then enbedded the claims and evidence using BERT and trained the classification model.
