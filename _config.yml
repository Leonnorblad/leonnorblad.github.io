about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Last year Master's student in Statistics and Machine Learning.
  Eager to follow the advancements of AI/ML and find new possibilities to leverage this new technology.
  Currently working on my master's thesis at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE).
  Once my thesis is completed in June, I am interested in a full-time employment in AI/ML, preferably in Stockholm.
  
  Hit me up if you are looking for:
  - An awesome colleague to join your team üåü
  - A collaborator on a ML projectü§ù

  Or just want to chat about AI/ML in generalüí°

        title: Master thesis at RISE
        description: |
          I am currently working on my master's thesis at the Research Institutes of Sweden.
          My thesis is a part of the EU project *Circular and Sustainable Textile and Clothing* <a href="https://cisutac.eu" target="_blank">cisutac.eu</a>.
          Which is a large initiative to increase textile circularity in Europe.
          More specifically, my thesis aims to automate the sorting process.
          By using machine vision, I am developing a damage detection model to gain a better understanding of the condition of the garment.
          This information is essential for a sorting decision.

        title: Claim Verification Using Generated Data by ChatGPT and Wikipedia
        link: github.com/Leonnorblad/fact-verification
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          As a part of the LiU text-mining course, I decided to dive deeper in the task of fact verification.
          The model I developed analyzes a user input string and predicts its truthfulness. This is performed by
          comparing the input string to a paragapth of evidence. To extract claims and evidence to train the model I
          scraped wikipedia pages and then fed the articles together with instructions to generate a claim to ChatGPT
          with the help of OpenAIs API. I then enbedded the claims and evidence using BERT and trained the classification network.
          Code and pdf report is available on my GitHub.

        description: |
         As a part of the LiU course Bioinformatics (732A51), I developed an R package for sequence alignment and visualization.
         The package uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align sequences and also provides the option to visualize the alignment
         in a matrix plot with arrows illustrating the paths and scores of different alignments.
         The package is available on CRAN and can be installed to R simply by running `install.packages("SeqAlignR")`.

        title: LLM - detect AI generated text
        link: kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text
        description: |
          Competition hosted by Kaggle.
          The task was to identify which essay was written by a large language model.
          Together with my two teammates [Elias] and [Filip] we developed an ensemble model consisting of Multinomial Naive Bayes,
          Stochastic Gradient Descent (with modified Huber loss), LightGBM (gradient boosting model), and CatBoost (gradient boosting on decision trees).
          A key aspect of our solution, except the use of an ensemble model, was to use a large ngram in our vectorization of the text.
          Our final submission reached a private LB AUC score of 0.893, giving us a top 36% placement.
